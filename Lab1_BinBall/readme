Laboratory #2

There is only one execution script: BinBalls.py.
The command to execute it is:
  python BinBalls.py --bins B --runs R
  where:
        -B is the number of bins: [1,2,4];
        -R is the number of runs.

There are present some output files (OutputFiles.zip) so that if want to run the plotting scripts you can without simulate them (you are free to do it anyway).

There are 3 plotting scripts:
1) python PlotResults.py --bins B --runs R
        -It plots a graph of the results obtained with the given B and R.

2) python PlotResults_ComparePolicies.py --runs R
        -It compares the different policies (B=[1,2,4]) for a given R.

3) python PlotResults_RelErr.py --bins B
        -It compares the relative errors (R=[3,5,10]) for a given B.
