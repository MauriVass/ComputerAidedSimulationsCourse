Laboratory #2.2

There is only one execution script: BirthdayParadox.py.
The command to execute it is:
  python BirthdayParadox.py --ind_day D --runs R [-isMin]
  where:
        -D: is the index of the number of days: (0:365, 1:10**5, 2:10**6);
        -R: is the number of runs.
        -isMin: is used to find minimum number of people needed to experience a collision

There are present some output files (OutputFiles.zip) so that if want to run the plotting scripts you can without simulate them (you are free to do it anyway).

There is 1 plotting script:
1) python PlotResultsProb.py --ind_day D --runs R [-relError]
        -relError: is used whether you want the relative errors or not
