Laboratory #3

-Fingerprint
There is only one script: Fingerprint.py. The only requirement (same for the other scripts) is the presence of the file with the English words
with the name words_alpha.txt in this folder (./words_alpha.txt) (Link: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt)

-Bit String Array & Bloom filter
There is one simulations script (BTA_BF.py) and 3 plotting scripts (PlotResults.py, PlotResultsBFq10.py, PlotResultsBFq11.py).

The BTA_BF.py can take 3 command line arguments:
  dataS: Data Structure to be used: 0:bit string array, 1:simple bloom filter
  runs: the number of runs
  words: Number words used for checking collisions (only for bloom filter)
Example: BitStringArray.py --dataS 0 --runs 2 --words 30000

BTA_BF.py output is a .dat file that is elaborated by PlotResults.py script
The PlotResults.py must take 1 command line arguments:
  Data Structure to be used: 0:bit string array, 1:simple bloom filter
Example: PlotResults.py 0 (or 1)

PlotResultsBFq10.py plot a graph for the q10. It does not require inputs.

PlotResultsBFq11.py plot a graph for the q11. It does not require inputs.
